Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
Overview
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The model classifies MRI scans into tumor or non-tumor categories, helping in early diagnosis.

üóÇ Features
Tumor Detection Portal: Upload an MRI scan to check for the presence of a tumor.
Informational Webpage: Provides knowledge about brain tumors, symptoms, and treatment options.
Chatbot: Assists users by answering queries related to brain tumors.
Find Neurologists: Helps users locate the best neurologists nearby.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask
Database: SQLite
Machine Learning Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

üèóÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Used a dataset of MRI brain scans.
Resized and normalized images for model training.

Model Training:
Built a CNN model for classification.
Used techniques like augmentation to improve performance.

Web Application:
Created a Flask-based portal for users to upload MRI images.
Integrated a chatbot and neurologist location feature.
